# ðŸŽ¯ Eklipse Portfolio â€“ Game Clip Engagement Prediction

This project aims to analyze game clip data and build a model to predict **user engagement** with uploaded clips on the *Eklipse* platform.  
The analysis covers **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Loading** â€“ Read raw datasets from `data/raw`.
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** â€“ Analyze trends, distributions, and feature relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Transform numerical & categorical features.
4. **Modeling** â€“ Build Logistic Regression to predict engagement probability.
5. **Model Saving** â€“ Save the trained model as `.joblib` for deployment.

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
The most influential factors affecting engagement:

Clip duration

Upload time

Game title

Event type

Logistic Regression produces probabilities for engagement per clip.

ðŸ“„ Notes
Raw datasets are not included in this public repository due to size limitations & privacy reasons.
A .gitignore file is used to prevent large or sensitive files from being pushed.
